## CIS 4970 Final Project: Interactive Tennis Simulator
Iris Gallo, Spring 2024 </br>
Using Qt and OpenGL to create a tennis simulator.

-----

### Completed Items
* Alpha Review
  * 2D ball impacted by gravity, drag, and lift (from rotation) forces
  * Basic racquet collision to determine the ball's new translational velocity 
  * Court and net collision with basic bounce
  * Debug view to visualize the forces on the ball, the orientation of the racquet, and collisions

-----

### Beta Roadmap / Next Steps
* Week 3/11-3/15
  * Compute ball rotation from racquet collision
  * Add frictional bounce
  * Start 3D environment and render a sphere
* Week 3/16-3/22
  * Expand 2D physics to 3D project
  * Start with the ball's trajectory based on gravity, drag, and lift
  * Then, add racquet collision and its impact on the ball's translational/rotational velocity
* Week 3/23 - 3/29 (Beta Review)
  * Spillover time
  * Stretch: Begin researching how to connect a Wii controller
